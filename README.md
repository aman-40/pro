This project is a personal portfolio site. A new "Numbers" section was added as `src/component/Numbers.js` with styles in `src/component/Numbers.css`.

How to view:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start dev server: `npm start`

The new section is rendered by placing `<Numbers />` inside the main application (already added to `src/App.js`).
